   Ice-cool ðŸ§Š Remix + Directus starter template.
</h3>

## What's cool in the stack?

- [Remix](https://remix.run/) as a web framework (using [Architect](https://arc.codes/))
- Content API and dashboard with [Directus](https://directus.io/)
- [PosgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) + [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for data persistence
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Cypress](https://cypress.io) - E2E testing framework
- Unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - for UI development
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) as a monorepo and build system

## Prerequisites
- [node](https://nodejs.org/) - at least v14
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - at least v1.22.19
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) - for spinning up your local PosgreSQL database & pgAdmin. If you don't want to run a database on your local machine, you can use the free tier of [Directus cloud services](https://directus.cloud/).

## How to start:
- Run `yarn run bootstrap` - that will install and build all the project dependencies & packages
- Run `yarn run dev` - turborepo will spin up all 'dev' scripts across the monorepo. You can also run each project's dev scripts separately.
- Log in to your directus dashboard using these credentials `user: admin@example.com | password: admin`.
- For production usage, make sure to fill in your `.env` files in api & page directories. It's best not to version these files in your repository.


### Deployment

#### Page
The **Remix** app in this repository comes with an [Architect](https://arc.codes/) adapter, as it's working best for our use cases.

Refer to [architect's docs](https://arc.codes/docs/en/reference/cli/deploy) for the a detailed guide on that topic.

#### API
Refer to [directus docs](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/quickstart.html) for a guide on how to deploy a self-hosted directus instance.

We recommend deploying to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html) using Docker.
